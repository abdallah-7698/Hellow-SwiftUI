- **Future-Proofing**: Keep UIKit components in a separate folder to allow easy replacement with SwiftUI equivalents in the future.
- **Ease of UI Updates**: Learn how SwiftUI simplifies UI modifications.

## Tasks in This Project

1. Integrate a UIKit view into a SwiftUI app.
2. Understand how to separate and organize UIKit components for future updates.
