# Barcode Scanner

The Barcode Scanner app bridges the gap between UIKit and SwiftUI by passing data using coordinators and delegates. It is designed to demonstrate advanced data handling techniques in SwiftUI.

## Features

- **Data Passing**: Transfer data from UIKit views to SwiftUI using coordinators and delegates.
- **Multiple Barcode Scanning**: Enable the app to scan multiple barcodes in one session.
- **Error Handling**: Implement robust error handling mechanisms in SwiftUI.
- **Cleaner Code**: Refactor code for better readability and maintainability.

## Tasks in This Project

1. Refactor the code to improve readability and maintainability.
2. Connect between UIKit and SwiftUI
3. Add support for scanning multiple barcodes in one session.
