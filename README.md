3. Run the app on a simulator or a physical device to explore the examples.
4. Experiment with the code to better understand how each concept works.

## Why SwiftUI?

SwiftUI redefines how developers build user interfaces by providing:

- A declarative syntax that makes your code more readable and concise.
- Seamless integration with Swift, Apple's modern programming language.
- Live previews in Xcode that allow you to see your changes in real time.
- Built-in support for accessibility, animations, and localization.
